# PH212-Final-Project-
matplot/numpy graph for double slit interference problem

Problem Prompt: 
You have a laser that can be tuned to any wavelength of visible light. You shine this laser through
a mask with two slits, as shown below. Create and label a diagram of the pattern that appears on a
screen that has been placed a distance L away from the mask. The location of bright and dark
spots should be quantitatively accurate; the relative intensity should be qualitatively accurate. As
usual, you should have symbolic expressions as part of your solution, after which you should use
s = 0.5 mm, L = 2.0 m, and Î» = 550 nm to make your diagram. Your diagram should include many
bright and dark spots (enough to see all the interesting parts of the pattern), and you should include
additional diagrams alongside your sensemaking.
